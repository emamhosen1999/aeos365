 * Employee Service Contract
 *
 * Defines the contract for employee-related operations across package boundaries.
 * HRM package implements this; Core package depends on it for notifications/access.
 *
 * This enables:
 * - Core to resolve employee data without importing HRM models
 * - Clean dependency inversion (Core ← Contract → HRM)
 * - Testability with mock implementations
 *
 * ARCHITECTURAL RULE: All methods use employee_id as the primary identifier.
 * user_id is only used for mapping purposes.
